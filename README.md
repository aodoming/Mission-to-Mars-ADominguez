Extracting data from active website(webscraping) using Chrome Developer Tools to identify the HTML and CSS components attached to the data we want. Also using a Python script that uses Beautiful Soup and Splinter to automate browser and gather the data identified. 
Splinter automates the web browser that navigates other websites on its own, and Beautiful Soup extracts the data. 
The data is then stored in a JSON data structure using MongoDB (a NoSQL Database).
Finally, building a web application using flask, which executes our scraping code and help update newest data on page.
